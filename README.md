# DynamicLabelPropagation
Dynamic label propagation ML algorithm implemented in Rust.
Functions are contained within src/main.rs.
The code is currently set up to run tests from samples of the USPS digit image dataset and test accuracy of the algorithm.
Algorithm as described in the following paper:
